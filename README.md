# Image PCA Reconstruction üñºÔ∏è

A Python project that compresses and reconstructs a grayscale image using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Dataset
- Use your own grayscale image named - <a href="https://github.com/codingchapa/image-pca-reconstruction/blob/main/input.jpg"> input.jpg</a> in the project folder.

## Features

- Loads and processes grayscale images  
- Standardizes pixel data for PCA  
- Applies PCA to reduce image data dimensions  
- Reconstructs and shows the compressed image  
- Displays original and reconstructed images side-by-side  

## What It Shows

- How PCA can reduce image size while keeping important details  
- The effect of the number of PCA components on image quality  

## How It Works

1. Load and preprocess the image  
2. Apply PCA to reduce dimensions  
3. Reconstruct the image from PCA data  
4. Visualize original vs reconstructed images  

## What I Learned

- Basic image compression using PCA  
- Data preprocessing and standardization  
- Visualization with Python libraries like matplotlib and PIL
